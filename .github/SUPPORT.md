# Getting help

Please check the list of [Frequently Asked Questions](https://github.com/citp/BlockSci/wiki) first, especially the list of [Common Issues](https://github.com/citp/BlockSci/wiki#toc-common-issues) if you are not using our AMI.

If you've encountered a bug or have a question about using BlockSci not answered in the FAQ, the best way to get help is to open a GitHub issue. We are an academic team and aren't able to provide the standard of support that you might expect for a commercial project, but we'll do our best.

## Team & contact info

BlockSci was created by Harry Kalodner, Steven Goldfeder, Alishah Chator, Malte MÃ¶ser, and Arvind Narayanan at Princeton University. It is supported by NSF grants CNS-1421689 and CNS-1651938 and an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship under grant number DGE-1148900. We've released a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02489) describing BlockSci's design and a few applications that illustrate its capabilities. You can contact the team at [blocksci@lists.cs.princeton.edu](mailto:blocksci@lists.cs.princeton.edu).
