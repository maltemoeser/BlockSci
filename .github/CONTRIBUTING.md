# Contributing

We highly welcome contributions to BlockSci! Below we've listed a few ways you can help improve BlockSci:

- *Maintenance:* We greatly appreciate help in maintaining BlockSci, including raising issues with reproducible examples, reviewing pull requests, helping answer questions about using BlockSci, or fixing smaller bugs.
- *Documentation:* We welcome contributions that improve our [documentation](https://citp.github.io/BlockSci/) and [FAQ](https://github.com/citp/BlockSci/wiki) or add helpful comments to the code.
- *Testing:* We welcome contributions that extend or improve our existing Python test suite. We also welcome improvements of the [testchain-generator](https://github.com/citp/testchain-generator) that we use to generate a synthetic blockchain to run tests against.
- *Code contributions:* If you're interested in making larger code contributions (e.g., adding new features, extensive rewrites of existing code), please contact us first (by opening an issue or sending us an [email](mailto:blocksci@lists.cs.princeton.edu)).


## Development Branch

Most contributions should use the current development branch as a starting point (currently this is [v0.6](https://github.com/citp/BlockSci/tree/v0.6)). The development branch can be unstable at times. The master branch contains the last stable version for which an AMI was released. All other branches are feature branches that shouldn't be used.
